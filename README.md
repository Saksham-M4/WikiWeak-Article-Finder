🔎 WikiFact Check

Evidence-First Wikipedia Fact Consistency Checker

WikiFact Check is a Streamlit-based application that checks whether a structured fact from a Wikipedia article's infobox is supported by the corresponding article text.

The system is designed around an evidence-first workflow:

WikiWeak Dataset
      ↓
Article Title Resolution
      ↓
Wikipedia Article Retrieval
      ↓
Infobox Fact Extraction
      ↓
Article Text Analysis
      ↓
Fact Normalization & Matching
      ↓
Match / Possible Mismatch / Not Found
      ↓
Exact Evidence Sentence + Wikipedia Article Image

The goal is not to judge whether an article is "good" or "bad". Instead, the application answers a focused question:

Does the information in the structured Wikipedia infobox agree with the information stated in the article text?

🎯 Problem Statement

Wikipedia presents information in multiple forms.

For example, an article may contain:

A structured infobox with a birth date

A founder field

A location field

A country field

The same information expressed naturally inside paragraphs

A simple string search can produce incorrect results when the same fact is written in a different form.

For example:

Infobox:
Larry Page; Sergey Brin

Article:
Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

A basic exact-string search may fail because the wording and punctuation are different.

WikiFact Check therefore separates the problem into:

Fact extraction

Normalization

Relevant article-text matching

Evidence extraction

Three-state classification

✨ Key Features

1. WikiWeak Dataset Integration

The application connects to the WikiWeak article dataset and automatically detects the article-title column.

Supported title-column names include:

name
title
article_title
article_name
article name

The current connected dataset uses:

name

The application also displays the detected title column and the number of connected article records in the interface.

2. Wikipedia Article Retrieval

After an article title is supplied, the application retrieves the corresponding English Wikipedia article.

It obtains:

Article title

Infobox information

Article text

Wikipedia article URL

Main article image when available

3. Multiple Fact Types

The current fact-checking workflow supports:

Fact Type

Example

Birth Date

Narendra Modi → 17 September 1950

Founder

Google → Larry Page, Sergey Brin

Location

Organization/place → stated location

Country

Entity → stated country

The architecture is designed so additional fact types can be added later.

🧠 Fact-Matching Approach

The application does not depend only on literal string equality.

Birth Date

Different date representations can refer to the same date:

1950-09-17
17 September 1950
September 17, 1950
17/09/1950

These representations can be normalized before comparison.

Therefore:

Infobox: 1950-09-17

Article:
Narendra Modi (born 17 September 1950) ...

can be classified as:

MATCH

Founder

Founder information may appear in different natural-language forms.

For example:

Infobox:
Larry Page, Sergey Brin

Article:
Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

The system normalizes the names and searches the article text for supporting information instead of requiring an identical raw string.

🏷️ Three Result States

The application deliberately uses only three final outcomes.

🟢 MATCH

The structured fact and article text represent the same information and supporting evidence is available.

Example:

MATCH — both information are the same.

🟠 POSSIBLE MISMATCH

The article contains relevant information, but it does not agree with the structured fact after normalization.

Example:

Infobox: 1980
Article: 1981

The application reports:

POSSIBLE MISMATCH

This wording avoids claiming more certainty than the available article evidence supports.

⚪ NOT FOUND

The requested corresponding information cannot be found in the available article text.

Example:

Fact type: Country
Article: [no corresponding country information]

The application reports:

NOT FOUND

📖 Evidence-First Output

A key feature of WikiFact Check is that the result is not presented as a bare label.

When supporting or conflicting evidence is found, the application displays the:

Exact evidence sentence from the Wikipedia article

The interface therefore provides:

Result
   ↓
Infobox information
   ↓
Exact evidence sentence
   ↓
Wikipedia article

This makes the result easier to inspect and demonstrate.

🖼️ Wikipedia Article Image

When Wikipedia provides a main article image, the application automatically displays it.

For example:

Narendra Modi
      ↓
Wikipedia image
      ↓
Infobox birth information
      ↓
Fact-check result
      ↓
Evidence sentence

If an article does not have a suitable image, the fact-checking workflow can still operate normally.

🗂️ Dataset Workflow

The application uses the WikiWeak dataset primarily for article-title discovery and dataset integration.

The workflow is:

WikiWeak CSV
     ↓
Detect title column
     ↓
Load article titles
     ↓
Select / enter article
     ↓
Retrieve current Wikipedia article
     ↓
Extract structured fact
     ↓
Compare against article text

The application does not assume that the dataset itself contains the final answer to every fact-check.

Instead, it uses the article title to locate the corresponding Wikipedia article and perform the consistency check.

🧪 Recommended Demonstration Tests

The following tests cover the major requirements of the project.

Test 1 — Birth Date Match

Article: Narendra Modi
Fact Type: Birth Date

Expected:

MATCH

The application should show:

Narendra Modi article image

Infobox birth date

Evidence sentence

Wikipedia article link

Test 2 — Founder Match

Article: Google
Fact Type: Founder

Expected:

MATCH

The application should show:

Google article image

Founder information

Supporting evidence sentence

Wikipedia article link

Test 3 — Another Article

Example:

Article: Mahendra Singh Dhoni
Fact Type: Birth Date

Expected:

MATCH

This demonstrates that the application is not hard-coded only for Narendra Modi.

Test 4 — Possible Mismatch

Use an article/fact combination where the structured information and article evidence disagree.

Expected:

POSSIBLE MISMATCH

The application should display the relevant evidence when available.

Test 5 — Not Found

Choose a fact type for which the corresponding information is unavailable in the article.

Expected:

NOT FOUND

This demonstrates that the system distinguishes missing information from an actual mismatch.

1. Resolve article title
        ↓
2. Retrieve Wikipedia article
        ↓
3. Extract infobox birth date
        ↓
4. Extract article text
        ↓
5. Normalize date representations
        ↓
6. Search for supporting evidence
        ↓
7. Compare information
        ↓
8. Return MATCH
        ↓
9. Display evidence sentence
        ↓
10. Display article image

🔐 Design Principles

Evidence Before Conclusion

The application attempts to provide supporting article evidence rather than displaying only a result label.

Normalization Before Comparison

Equivalent representations should be normalized before deciding whether information differs.

Three-State Classification

The system separates:

Same
Different
Unavailable

into:

MATCH
POSSIBLE MISMATCH
NOT FOUND

Explainability

The user can inspect:

The structured infobox information

The article evidence

The Wikipedia source

The article image

⚠️ Limitations

WikiFact Check is an experimental fact-consistency checker and should not be treated as an authoritative fact-verification system.

1. Wikipedia Can Change

Wikipedia content may be edited after a result is produced.

2. Natural Language Is Complex

A sentence can contain information that requires context beyond simple matching.

3. Infoboxes Are Structured Differently

Different Wikipedia articles may use different infobox templates and field formats.

4. Evidence Selection

A sentence containing the relevant names or values does not always establish the exact semantic relationship intended by the fact type. Evidence matching is therefore an area for continued improvement.

5. API Availability

The application depends on access to Wikimedia services for live article retrieval and images.

🔮 Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

Stronger semantic sentence matching

Relationship-aware founder detection

More fact types

Better handling of aliases and alternate names

Multilingual Wikipedia support

Confidence indicators

Evidence ranking

Multiple evidence sentences

Historical Wikipedia revision comparison

Automated evaluation across a larger test set

Improved entity recognition

More robust infobox template handling

📊 Evaluation Strategy

A meaningful evaluation should test different:

Articles

People
Companies
Organizations
Places
Historical subjects

Fact Types

Birth Date
Founder
Location
Country

Outcomes

MATCH
POSSIBLE MISMATCH
NOT FOUND

The evaluation should include both straightforward and naturally worded examples.

🎓 Project Demonstration Flow

For a short classroom demonstration:

📜 Disclaimer

WikiFact Check is an educational and experimental software project.

A MATCH result means that the implemented comparison logic found supporting agreement between the selected structured fact and available article evidence. It does not independently establish the ultimate truth of a claim.

A POSSIBLE MISMATCH indicates that the available structured information and article evidence did not agree under the implemented matching rules.

A NOT FOUND result means the requested corresponding information was not found in the available article text.
